# CRUD-API-movie-project
I built a vanilla Nodejs CRUD API movie project. I created a http server, build Rest API and used thunder http client to test our APIs.  I did not use any framework or library to build this project. This is good practical hand-ons for beginners who just started their journey with Node.js.
